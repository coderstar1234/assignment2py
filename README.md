Sum of Squares.

Himanshu Vashistha

Write a Python function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of the squares of all the numbers in the list.

Here's an implementation of a Python function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of the squares of all the numbers in the list:

python

Copy code

def sum_squares(numbers):

    """

    Returns the sum of the squares of all the numbers in the given list.

    """

    sum = 0

    for num in numbers:

        sum += num**2

    return sum

To use this function, simply pass in a list of numbers as an argument:

python

Copy code

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

result = sum_squares(my_list)

print(result)  # Output: 55 (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 55)

In the sum_squares function, we first initialize a variable sum to 0. We then loop through each number in the input list numbers, and add the square of each number to the sum variable using the += operator. Finally, we return the sum variable.
